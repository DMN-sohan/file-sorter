# Sile-Sorter v1
This is the first rendition of my custom made File-Sorter.<br> 
It is simple to install, just click on <b>Code</b> and then <b>Download ZIP</b><br> 
Extract the .zip file and run <b>file-sorter.exe</b>
<br><br>
To sort any folder, right-click your folder and click <b>Sort folder</b>
To track which folder a specific file has been moved to, open and check <b>log.txt</b>
